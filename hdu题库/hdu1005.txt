Number Sequence

Problem Description 

 A number sequence is defined as follows:f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(n) = (A * f(n - 1) + B * f(n - 2)) mod 7.Given A, B, and n, you are to calculate the value of f(n).

 The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case contains 3 integers A, B and n on a single line (1 &lt;= A, B &lt;= 1000, 1 &lt;= n &lt;= 100,000,000). Three zeros signal the end of input and this test case is not to be processed.

 For each test case, print the value of f(n) on a single line.
